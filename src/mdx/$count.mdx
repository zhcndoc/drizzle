`db.$count()` is a utility wrapper of `count(*)`, it is a very flexible operator which can be used as is or as a subquery, more details in our [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/discussions/3119).

<Section>
```ts
const count = await db.$count(users);
//    ^? number

const count = await db.$count(users, eq(users.name, "Dan")); // works with filters
```
```sql
select count(*) from "users";
select count(*) from "users" where "name" = 'Dan';
```

It is exceptionally useful in [subqueries](/docs/select#select-from-subquery):

```ts
const users = await db.select({
  ...users,
  postsCount: db.$count(posts, eq(posts.authorId, users.id)),
}).from(users);
```

usage example with [relational queries](/docs/rqb)
```ts 
const users = await db.query.users.findMany({
  extras: {
    postsCount: db.$count(posts, eq(posts.authorId, users.id)),
  },
});
```
