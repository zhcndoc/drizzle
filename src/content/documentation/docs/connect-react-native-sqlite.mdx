# Drizzle \<\> React Native SQLite
Please use [`Expo SQLite`](#expo-sqlite) to run Drizzle ORM with React Native apps.  
The only [popular library](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) we've found does not support new Hermes JavaScript runtime, 
which is a standard out of the box runtime for React Native and Expo now.
